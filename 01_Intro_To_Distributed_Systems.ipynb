    "#  Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how Blockchain works, we must first discuss how distributed systems work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to explain the building blocks for any distributed system, and specifically a peer-to-peer system. P2P environment is a network where peers are connected, exchange information and run applications on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals are as follows:\n",
    "- We will build a system block by block.\n",
    "- Distributed systems are hard as there are many random errors: race conditions, nasty bugs, deadlocks.\n",
    "- We will simplify the world to get to the juiciest parts without leaving out the essentials.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will simulate the P2P environment locally to get an idea of how such systems would work and understand the design decision that developers make.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show the different tradeoffs and why developers and researchers choose specific designs, we need a way to simulate such an environment. Here we will simulate the network and message exchange via a  discrete event simulator: [SimPy](simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",

    "For the simplicity of use, you can use wrapper for SimPY implement a P2P network simulation: `p2psimpy`. \n",

    "# Simulation of P2P environments\n",
    "\n",
    "We start the notebook by introducing the backbone for such a simulation: `BaseSimulation`.\n",
    "This class represents the network of peers with their physical representations in the world, such as physical `location`, [`bandwidth`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)). \n",
    "\n",
    "These properties both define and restrict the capabilities of how fast you can transfer messages and how message travel through the network (which peers see the message, which channels are used).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`BaseSimulation` consists of 3 main parameters: \n",
    " - *Locations*\n",
    " - *Network Topology* \n",
    " - *Services and Message Processors* \n",

    "### Simulating latencies between locations\n",
    "\n",

    "This is a very rough representation of reality but is sufficient for us. You can read more about jitter and latency [here](https://www.tpx.com/blog/latency-jitter-and-packet-loss/) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdbJdUh6W08).   \n",
